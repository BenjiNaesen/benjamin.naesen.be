          <p>Welcome, my name is <strong>Benjamin Naesen</strong>. I'm a New Media and Communication Technology (NMCT) student at Howest, Kortrijk in Belgium.</p>

          <p>I've got a <strong>passion for IT</strong> as u will see on the other pages of the website and I try to share that experience with family and friends. The section of IT that I'm <strong>captivated by</strong> the most is we <strong>development and programming</strong> as I can literally find thousands of solutions to end up with the same answer. I try to explore these solutions and see which one suits a certain task the best.</p>

          <p><strong>Another passion</strong> next to IT is <strong>cycling</strong>. In my honest opinion, it's an iconic sport that broadly resembles life. Once u hit the barrier, u keep on going. If something goes wrong, pick that bike up again and keep on going. That's why I like the sport. And it's also pretty damn cool to ride off the side of a mountain...</p>
